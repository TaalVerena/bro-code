## Planning

### Crafting the Bro Code Experience
The journey of building the Bro Code website began with a vision to create a vibrant online space that embodies unity, adventure, and a shared love for coding. With a basic structure in mind—featuring a captivating hero image, a dynamic color scheme, and sections dedicated to groups, meetups, and -I embarked on the creative process armed using Figma wireframes.

#### Starting with the Basics
At the inception stage, I understood the importance of solid foundations. Figma provided me with a canvas to lay out the essential components of my website. My initial wireframes mapped out the core structure, highlighting the placement of the navigation bar, the hero section, and the main content areas—groups, meetups, and about us. This helped me visualize the overall layout and flow of the website, ensuring a seamless user experience.

#### Translating Vision into Design
With the hero image and vibrant color scheme as my guiding lights, I translated my vision into a tangible design. Using wireframes, I sketched out the arrangement of elements within each section, experimenting with various layouts and placements to find the perfect balance of aesthetics and functionality. This stage allowed us to iterate and refine the design ideas before diving into the detailed implementation.

#### Responsive Design for All
The commitment to crafting an inclusive experience led me to prioritize responsiveness. Recognizing the diversity of devices that users might access the website from, I set out to ensure that the design seamlessly adapts to different screen sizes—be it a larger monitor or a mobile phone. By creating wireframes for larger and smaller devices, I aimed to offer a consistent and enjoyable browsing experience for everyone.

#### Mapping the User Journey
The wireframing process also helped me visualize the user journey. As users navigate through the navigation bar, explore groups, discover upcoming meetups, and engage with the signup page, the wireframes along with my goal served as a map of this journey. It allowed me to ensure that each step is intuitive and engaging, aligning with my goal of creating a community-driven platform.

In essence, the wireframes and website goals were my compass, guiding me through the exciting process of turning an idea into my first ever website. This enabled me to envision the layout, experiment with design variations, and ensure responsiveness—ultimately shaping the Bro Code experience I'm proud to offer to coders, tech enthusiasts, and adventurers alike.

### Color Scheme
The Bro Code website's color scheme is carefully crafted to reflect the spirit of unity, adventure, and coding. Inspired by the vibrant hero image of a programmer,  our color palette is crafted to evoke a sense of  excitement that welcomes coders of all backgrounds. Each color serves a specific purpose in conveying the values and themes that define our community:

* This setion confirms to the user that Bro Code is located in Munster, Ireland, and that all levels of programmers are welcome in our community.
* The background color used is the color gradient in the Groups section, but in reverse. This is used to take the website from the blue accents in the Meetups section to the purple color used in the footer.
* The colorful strip used at the start and end of the About Us section ties in the symbols used in the Bro Code logo as well as the colors used throughout the webiste. As this colorful feature was added, the text within this section is kept more minimal with the only other pop of color being a purple border. The border itself is again on the side as opposied to top and bottom as used in the Group section to give it a familiar, but altered affect.
* This section is responsive to different devices and uses the same layout on all devices, with the margins, padding and font adjusting for each device.

    ![Signup Page Mobile](README-media/signup-page-mobile.png)

#### Thank You Page
* The Thank Youb Page is presented to the user after the signup form submission.
* This page is kept minimal with confirmation to the uer that the form has been submitted successfuly and that they will shortly receive an email with a Discord link.

    ![Thank You Page](README-media/thank-you-page.png)
    ![Thank You Page Mobile](README-media/thank-you-page-mobile.png)

#### Favicon
* The Bro Code favicon was designed using the same purple as the header and footer as well as the symbols used in the logo.
* This was created to distinguish the website / tab from other websites the user may have open to enable them to easily navigate back to the Bro Code website.

    ![Favicon](README-media/favicon.png)

### Future Features to Implement
* As this website was deisgned for a portfolio project using HTML and CSS, the information from the signup page is not collected at present. Building on this to make it functional and have a running website is a feature I would like to implement at a later stage.
* Once the webiste is in use, I would like to expand to other countries to cater to more users.
* Work with local companies and suppliers to organize group events, discounts and special offers for the Bro Code community.
* Cater the website to also be responsive on much larger devices, excluding the most commonly used device sizes that have already been catered for.

## Testing
* I tested my website on Chrome, Firefox and Edge.
* I confirmed that my website is responsive, maintains good structure and image quality, and functions as intended on all standard screen sizes using Dev Tools.
* Basic adjustments made for much larger devices.
* I tested my website on 3 different PCs, 2 different laptops and 6 different phones.
* I confirmed that the text throughout the website is easily read and understood.
* I have confirmed that the form works, requires an email address, the submit button works and takes the user to a thank you page.

### Lighthouse
I tested my website using the Lighthouse feature on Dev Tools. All 3 pages returned the desired results.

* Main Page Lighthouse Results

* Signup Page Lighthouse Results

* Thank You Page Lighthouse Results
![Lighthouse Thank You Page](README-media/lighthouse-thank-you-page.png)

### Validator Testing
* HTML

    I checked all 3 files and no errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator.

    ![Validator HTML](README-media/validator-html.png)

* CSS

    I checked my CSS file and no errors were returned when passing through the official Jigsaw validator.

    ![Validator CSS](README-media/validator-css.png)

### Bugs

## Fixed Bugs
* When using Am I Responsive, I discovered a horizontal scroll bar on mobile devices.
* I inspected my code and used Unicorn Revealer to adjust my margins and width for smaller devices. This fixed the bug and the horizontal scroll bar no longer appears.

## Unfixed Bugs
* The only unfixed bug is that on 2 of the mobiles I tested my live site on, I encountered an error with the navigation links.
* When on those specific mobiles and on the home page, all section links work as intended. However, when going to the signup page and then clicking on a section link in the header, this goes to the landing page instead of the section on the main page.
* I was unable to replicate this on the other 4 mobiles I tested my website on and all testing using Dev Tools worked as intended.
* I researched this and found suggestions of adding a ? before the # in the id name, clearing the cache or using basic JavaScript. However, none of these returned the desired results.
* Further research will be done to find the fix and this will be impleneted.

## Deployment
* The repo was created using the Code Instutute template and cloned using VS Code.
* I used regular commits and ensured the commit messages were to the point and the code was sectioned into small groups of information.
* My website was deployed to GitHub pages.
